Refactoring existing code to make sure it meets accessibility the criteria.

As a bootcamp student, I want to refactor the existing code so that it's easy to read and for fellow developers who would access this code.

I've updated this project in order to organize the starter code given in order to understand it with ease.

By structuring the code in seperate sections using semantic HTML elements and updating the CSS stylesheet to fit the elements provided, it will help others with a reliable and streamlined code and can decipher different parts of the website.
