Refactoring existing code to make sure it meets the accessibility the criteria.

As a bootcamp student, I want to refactor the existing code with semantic HTML elements so that it is organised and easy to read.

This project has been updated in order to organize the starter code in a way that is easy to understand for fellow developers who would view this code. 

By structuring the code in seperate sections using semantic HTML elements, and updating the CSS stylesheet to fit the elements provided, it will help others to view the website with a reliable and streamlined code. This becomes easier to decipher different parts of the website.
